[B]Version 0.3.1[/B]

- fixed a really stupid indent error


[B]Version 0.3.1[/B]

- added cancelalarm call in case run more than once

[B]Version 0.3.5[/B]

- now runs as a service instead of needing the autoexec.py file

- removed sample autoexec.py

[B]Version 0.3.9[/B]
 
- running video and music scans side by side never really worked. Now checks if scan is running and waits until complete before running the next scan. 

[B]Version 0.4.0[/B]

- Had a user suggestion to allow for a manual launch of the process as well as the service. Since the service point will ALWAYS launch on startup the manual option will kick off the library update process. 

[B]Version 0.4.1[/B]

-added extra setting for a "startup delay" timer. This will only affect the addon when xbmc starts. 
-the last running time is now set to a variable so that manual updates will reset the timer, and system resets will start the service where it left off

[B]Version 0.5.0[/B]

-major changes to settings, split them by General and Timer category
-Advanced timer functions now add the ability to do cron-like scheduling of the update process, thanks to pkscuot for the timer ideas
-option to skip during media playback or run the update anyway

[B]Version 0.5.1[/B]

-merged changes from pkscuot's branch. 
-rounds last_run to top of the minute (timer executes at 00 not anywhere in minute)
-creates addon data directory if it doesn't exist

[B]Version 0.5.2[/B]

-fixed os import error

[B]Version 0.5.4[/B]
 
 -fixed issue with startup timer, thanks stevenD

[B]Version 0.5.5[/B]

-changed cron expression library. Croniter will allow iterating through the cron expressions and show the next update time

-added methods to display a "countdown" when the next update will occur, and settings to display notifications

[B]Version 0.5.6[/B]

-updated the manual run interface to include information about when the updater will run again

[B]Version 0.5.7[/B]

- merged 'standard' and 'advanced' usage to follow more of the same codebase. Now the standard timer uses a cron expression as well and will start at the top of every hour

[B]Version 0.5.8[/B]

- added a 1 minute delay timer before running a scan if XBMC has just exited playback. This should help in scenerios where ending media viewing results in an immediate scan that the user didn't want. 

[B]Version 0.5.9[/B]

- added a custom video path option to only scan a specific video path instead of the entire library

[B]Version 0.6.0[/B]

- added "Cleaning" category to schedule a clean operation of the music/video databases. This operation can happen immediately after a scan or once per day/week/month. Verifying source paths before a clean is also supported
